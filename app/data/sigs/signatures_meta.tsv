On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. "	20	"Alexandrov L.B. et al., Nature (2013)"COSMIC 3	Signature 3 is associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination. 	30	"Alexandrov L.B. et al., Nature (2013)"COSMIC 4	"Signature 4 is associated with smoking and its profile is similar to the mutational pattern observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). Signature 4 is likely due to tobacco mutagens.

The presence of large numbers of Signature 10 mutations is associated with recurrent POLE somatic mutations, viz., Pro286Arg and Val411Leu. "	100	"Alexandrov L.B. et al., Nature (2013)"COSMIC 11	Signature 11 exhibits a mutational pattern resembling that of alkylating agents.

On the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems, a role for APOBEC1, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B in human cancer appears more likely than for other members of the family. Signature 13 causes predominantly C>G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1.
